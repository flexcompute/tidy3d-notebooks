Global Optimization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Photonic design optimization represents a cutting-edge frontier in photonics engineering, where sophisticated algorithms are employed to refine and enhance the performance of optical components and systems. This category showcases the power of gradient-free global optimization methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), and Genetic Algorithms (GA), in tackling complex design challenges that are otherwise intractable with traditional approaches such as a simple grid search. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in discovering optimal configurations for critical photonic functions.
For gradient-based optimization examples, please see the inverse design/ adjoint optimization section.
