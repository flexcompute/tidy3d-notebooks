Metamaterials, Gratings, and Other Periodic Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Periodic structures, including metamaterials and diffractive gratings, harness their inherent spatial periodicity to manipulate light. The application of periodic boundary conditions allows for the efficient modeling of just a single unit cell within these structures, significantly enhancing simulation speed and reducing computational costs. By using appropriate monitors, users can access various physical quantities including field distribution within the near-field zone and critical far-field metrics like reflection, transmission, absorption, and diffraction.
In addition, Tidy3Dâ€™s speed and scalability allow users to model the response of a large finite array of periodic devices, making it a more realistic simulation compared to real-world scenarios where the device size or the beam size is always finite.
