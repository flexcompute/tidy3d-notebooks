Optical Scattering and Far-field Radiation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we explore the interaction between light and materials at the nano and micro scales, focusing on how these interactions influence the scattering and radiation of light. This section covers the calculation of scattering cross-sections for scatterers using the total-field scattered-field (TFSF) source. Moreover, we demonstrate how to perform near-field to far-field projection.
