Microwave and RF Devices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Microwave and RF (Radio Frequency) devices are essential for communication and sensing applications. Microwave devices, operating between 1 GHz and 300 GHz, include waveguides, filters, antennas, and oscillators. RF devices, covering 3 kHz to 300 GHz, consist of amplifiers, switches, and filters. Tidy3D supports the simulation and optimization of these components through its microwave plugin.
