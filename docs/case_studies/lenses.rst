Lenses
~~~~~~

Lenses are pivotal components in many optical systems. In this section, we delve into microlens and metalens designs, showcasing advanced concepts that extend beyond traditional bulk lens-making techniques. Tidy3Dâ€™s speed and scalability shine when simulating large microlenses or metalenses in full 3D without any approximations, which is traditionally thought to be impossible.
