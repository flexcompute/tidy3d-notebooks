Active Photonic Integrated Circuit Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Active photonic integrated circuit (PIC) components are pivotal in enabling dynamic control and modulation of optical signals within photonic systems. This category focuses on devices that require external energy to alter the properties of light passing through them, facilitating functionalities such as tuning, modulation, and switching. These components are critical for the development of reconfigurable PICs, offering the ability to dynamically adjust system parameters for optimized performance across a range of applications, from telecommunications to sensing.
At the moment, Tidy3D’s heat solver can be used with the FDTD solver to model thermo-optic devices. To model electro-optic devices, a third-party semiconductor device simulator can be used and coupled to Tidy3D’s FDTD.
