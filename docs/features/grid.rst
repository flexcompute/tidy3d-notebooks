Grid Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tidy3D grid specifications enable the efficient simulation of intricate geometries. The AutoGrid feature automatically creates specific meshes for regions with different indices, reducing computational burden without compromising accuracy. Additionally, high customization is possible with mesh override structures. This section shows how to apply and customize grid specifications.
