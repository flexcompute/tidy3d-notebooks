Data Visualization and Postprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Visualizing and analyzing data is crucial for validating and extracting meaningful information from simulations. Tidy3D provides powerful features for easy visualization and postprocessing, often requiring just one line of code. This section provides examples of visualization tools for geometries and monitors, as well as advanced techniques for postprocessing monitor data.
