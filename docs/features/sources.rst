Sources
~~~~~~~

Sources are a fundamental component for input power in electromagnetic simulations. Tidy3D makes it straightforward to implement a variety of sources to meet diverse modeling needs, as well as offering options for creating fully customizable sources. In this section, the implementation and correct use of sources for different applications are presented.
