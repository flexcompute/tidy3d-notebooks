Mode Solver
~~~~~~~~~~~

Tidy3D offers convenient plugins for optical and waveguide mode analysis. With minimal work, one can access mode information for various waveguide geometries and perform complex post-processing analyses, such as mode overlap. This section provides notebooks to illustrate these features and exemplify how to run mode simulations in parallel.
