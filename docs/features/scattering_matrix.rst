Scattering Matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scattering matrix (S-matrix) calculation is a fundamental aspect of analyzing and retrieving information about the optical response of photonic integrated circuits (PICs). This section introduces Tidy3Dâ€™s ComponentModeler plugin, which simplifies the process of performing S-matrix calculations for complex PICs.
