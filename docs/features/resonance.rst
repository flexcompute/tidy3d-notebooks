Resonance Finder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Analyzing resonant frequencies in photonic cavities is a common task in electromagnetic simulation. While FDTD can analyze a broad spectrum in a single run, it may require long simulation times due to slow field decays. Tidy3D addresses this issue with the ResonanceFinder plugin, which provides a powerful signal-processing tool to retrieve resonance frequency and Q-factor information with minimal runtime. This section illustrates the plugin's use and provides application examples.
