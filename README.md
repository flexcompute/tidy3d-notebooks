# `tidy3d-notebooks`

You can see our [pretty example library documentation](https://docs.flexcompute.com/projects/tidy3d/en/latest/notebooks/docs/index.html) to explore each of these notebooks in more detail.

## Development Guidance

- Make sure all your internal API references start with ``tidy3d.<your_reference>``
- In notebooks, always have absolute links, otherwise the links will break when the user downloads them.
